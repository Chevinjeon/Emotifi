            <p> Studies show that people with ADHD tend to excel in divergent thinking, or thinking outside the box.  </p>

            <h2>Creativity and ADHD </h2>
            <p> Expressing creativity — in whatever way feels right — can have a significantly positive effect on people with ADHD
                    by regulating emotions, helping process memories, improving mood and lowering stress.</p>

            <h2> Music & Art Therapy </h2>
            <p>Many people with ADHD are typically in deficit of dopamine and require dopamine to get work done. 
                Music can provide that hit of dopamine4 they may need to either get started or keep going.
                The part of the brain that feels a reward from music—the nucleus accumbens—is the same one that psychostimulant ADHD medications work on. 
                The nucleus accumbens can be thought of as the brain's control center between motivation and action. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Music may also help improve mood in people with ADHD.  Research shows that music significantly reduced sadness and hopelessness. 
                (The good news: it also helped people who *don’t* have ADHD!) 
                It has also been found that keeping a stable rhythm and musical beat can have a calming effect that helps with a sense of security 
                and stability that can lead to emotional well-being and regulation of stress hormones—something people with ADHD may have a hard time doing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Making art creates natural moments to express thoughts and feelings in an environment that is often less threatening than talk therapy.
